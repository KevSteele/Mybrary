# Mybrary

This is a CRUD app that features the creating, searching, and editing, and deleting of books and authors.

Book's can be searched by title and filtered by published before/after dates.

Book's can be stored with a title, publish date, page count, a cover image (featuring filepond), a description, and an author.
The author must already be stored in the database, and can be selected via a drop down menu.

Views are managed by .ejs and styled with CSS. Site-wide color schemes are easily manageable by utilization of CSS variables.
